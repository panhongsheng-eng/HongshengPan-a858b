summary: >
  Deep Learning is a subfield of machine learning that uses multi-layered neural networks to learn representations from large datasets. It eliminates the need for manual feature engineering by automatically discovering patterns in raw data. Deep learning is the foundation of many AI advances in fields such as computer vision, natural language processing, speech recognition, and recommendation systems. Popular architectures include Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Transformers, and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). It has enabled AI systems to achieve or surpass human-level performance in numerous complex tasks.
