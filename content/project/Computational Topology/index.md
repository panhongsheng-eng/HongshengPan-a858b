summary: >
  Computational topology is an emerging field of study at the intersection of mathematics and computer science, devoted to the study of efficient algorithms for topological problems, 
  especially those that arise in other areas of computing. Although algorithmic techniques have been ubiquitous in topology since its inception more than a century ago, 
  the efficiency of topological algorithms and their applicability to other computing domains are relatively recent areas of study. 
  Results in computational topology combine classical mathematical techniques from combinatorial, geometric, and algebraic topology with more recent algorithmic tools from data structure design and computational geometry. 
  These results have found applications in many different areas of computer science.
