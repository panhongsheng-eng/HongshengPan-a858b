## ðŸ“šAffine Sets



#### line through $x_1$ and $x_2$: all points**:
$$
\large   x = \theta x_1 + (1 - \theta)x_2,\quad ( \theta \in \mathbb{R})
$$

> ##### ðŸš€ affine set: contains the line through any two distinct points in the set.

> ##### ðŸš€example solution set of linear equations  {${x| Ax = b}$}

## ðŸ“šConvex Set
#### line segment between $x_1$ and $x_2$: all points

$$
\large   x = \theta x_1 + (1 - \theta)x_2,\quad with \quad 0 \leq \theta \leq 1
$$

#### convex set: contains line segment between any two points in the set

$$
x_1, x_2 \in C ï¼Œ0 \leq \theta \leq 1 \quad then \quad \theta x_1 + (1 - \theta) x_2 \in C
$$

#### examples (one convex, two nonconvex sets)
