## 📚Affine Sets



**line through $x_1$ and $x_2$: all points**:
$$
\large   x = \theta x_1 + (1 - \theta)x_2,\quad ( \theta \in \mathbb{R})
$$

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> #### 🚀 affine set: contains the line through any two distinct points in the set.
>
> #### 🚀example solution set of linear equations  {${x| Ax = b}$}
